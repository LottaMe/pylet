# CHANGELOG

This file will for now include bigger changes in pylet, once it is open source, it will include changes to exercises as well. For now, it is mostly for changes and decisions on the pylet source code.
This will be written with the newest changes at the top, but I will create a few links to jump to specific sections:

- [First Solution - Subprocess](#first-solution---subprocess)
- [First Major Change - compile & exec](#first-major-change---compile--exec)
- [Introducing: Multiprocessing](#introducing-multiprocessing)

## Introducing: Multiprocessing
