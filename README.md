# pylet üêçü§ç

Greetingsss. Welcome to `pylet`, the hands-on way to learn python.

It is encouraged to do your own research while using `pylet`. Here are some sources recommended by us:

- [python docs tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [w3school python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

If you are using pylet as part of a course, check out the [teacher](./guides/teacher-guide.md) or [student](./guides/student-guide.md) guides.

## Prerequisites

To use `pylet`, you need to have python3 installed.
You can look up how to download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Getting Started

_This is a very early version of `pylet` and currently only tested on mac._

### Manually

#### Get Repository

First you need to get the repository locally.
You can either clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:LottaMe/pylet.git
```

Or you download the repository as a .zip and unpack it locally.

#### Create virtual environment

When you have the repository, open a terminal in the root folder of the repository.

First you need to create a virtual environment for the project. You do this with this command in the terminal:

```
python3 -m venv env
```

Next, enter the virtual environment:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Now that you are in the environment, you should install the dependencies in the requirements.tsx.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now the requirements are installed in the virtual environment env and you are ready to start with the exercises

## Run `pylet`

Before running pylet, be sure that you are in the created virtual environment. You should see a little (env) at the left side of your terminal.

If you are not in the environment, the following command will simply fail.

You can enter the environment with this command:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

To run pylet enter:

```
python pylet watch
```

You can always exit it, with a KeyboardInterrupt (control c).

As this is an early version, `pylet` may hang at times. Try exiting it and running pylet again.

_If you are using pylet as part of a course, check out the [teacher](./guides/teacher-guide.md) or [student](./guides/student-guide.md) guides, for more useful pylet commands_

## Solving exercises

After running `python pylet`, you will see the the current progress and the output of the first exercise in the terminal, as well as which exercise is running.

You can either command click on the path to the exercise (in the terminal) or look for the exercise in the exercises folder. Open the exercise python file and solve the exercise.

When the code is running successfully, You will get a success message in the terminal, to continue to the next exercise, you need to remove the ### I AM NOT DONE comment from the exercise file. Only when the code is running (and optionally the tests pass) and the ### I AM NOT DONE comment is removed, `pylet` will move on to the next exercise.

## Continuing on

After completing all the exercises in `pylet`, you should have a good understanding of the basics of python.

Now the important thing to do, is practice on real problems.

Python is a general-purpose programming language, meaning you can go in many different directions with it. A few examples:

- web development
- data science
- artificial intelligence

For all of these purposes there exist good (free) tutorials to start out with, just look them up, get started and have fun.
