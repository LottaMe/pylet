# How to use pylet as a student in a course

1. What did you receive:
2. Working on exercises
3. Keeping teachers up to date with your work

## 1. What did you receive:

Your teacher should have given you access to either a GitHub repository or a folder with a version of pylet.
The only thing you should worry about is the exercises folder.

First you need to set up the project locally. You can find all necessary information in the README.md file.

## 2. Working on exercises

After the dependencies are installed in your python environment, you can start pylet by entering python pylet watch in the terminal.

Now you can look at the output you are getting in the terminal - it should include the path to the current exercise - open the exercise, which will be in the exercises folder and get working on it.

## 3. Keeping teacher up to date with your work

With another pylet command, you will have an easier time updating your teacher about your progress. Just run the folling command:

```
python pylet summary
```

With the summary command, pylet will generate a summary.zip file that will include a folder with your completed exercises, the current exercise and a summary.md that lists the progress in a simple overview.

You can send this to your teacher if they need an update on your progress or if you are stuck, or unsure about your solutions.
